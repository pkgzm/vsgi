Router
======

Router is the core component of Valum. It dispatches request to the right
handler and processes certain error conditions described in
:doc:`redirection-and-error`.

HTTP methods
------------

Callback can be connected to HTTP methods via a list of helpers having the
``HandlerCallback`` delegate signature:

.. code:: vala

    app.get ("rule", (req, res, next) => {});

The rule has to respect the rule syntax described in :doc:`route`. It will be
compiled down to a regex which named groups are made accessible through
:doc:`vsgi/request` parameters.

Helpers for the HTTP/1.1 protocol and the extra ``TRACE`` methods are included.

-  ``get``
-  ``post``
-  ``put``
-  ``delete``
-  ``connect``
-  ``trace``

This is an example of ``POST`` request handling using `Soup.Form`_ to decode
the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` body of the :doc:`vsgi/request`.

.. _Soup.Form: http://valadoc.org/#!api=libsoup-2.4/Soup.Form

.. code:: vala

    app.post ("login", (req, res) => {
        var buffer = new MemoryOutputStream.resizable ();

        // consume the request body
        buffer.splice (req.body, OutputStreamSpliceFlags.CLOSE_SOURCE);

        var data = Soup.Form.decode ((string) buffer.get_data ());

        var username = data["username"];
        var password = data["password"];

        // assuming you have a session implementation in your app
        var session = new Session.authenticated_by (username, password);
    });

It is also possible to use a custom HTTP method via the ``method``
function.

.. code:: vala

    app.method ("METHOD", "rule", (req, res) => {});

:doc:`vsgi/request` provide an enumeration of HTTP methods for your
convenience.

.. code:: vala

    app.method (Request.GET, "rule", (req, res) => {});

Multiple methods can be captured with ``methods`` and ``all``.

.. code:: vala

    app.all ("", (req, res) => {
        // matches all methods registered in VSGI.Request.METHODS
    });

    app.methods (Request.GET, Request.POST, "", (req, res) => {
        // matches GET and POST
    });

Regular expression
------------------

.. code:: vala

    app.regex (/home/, (req, res) => {
        // matches /home
    });

Matcher callback
----------------

Request can be matched by a simple callback typed by the ``MatcherCallback``
delegate, but you have to be cautious if you want to fill request parameters.
You must respect the `populate if match` rule, otherwise you will experience
inconsistencies.

.. code:: vala

    app.matcher (Request.GET, (req) => { return req.uri.get_path () == "/home"; }, (req, res) => {
        // matches /home
    });

Status handling
---------------

Thrown status code can be handled by a ``HandlerCallback`` pretty much like how
typically matched requests are being handled.

The received :doc:`vsgi/request` and :doc:`vsgi/response` object are in the
same state they were when the status was thrown. The error message is passed in
the ``HandlerCallback`` last parameter named ``state``.

.. code:: vala

    app.status (Soup.Status.NOT_FOUND, (req, res, next, state) => {
        // produce a 404 page...
        var message = state.get_string ();
    });

Similarly to conventional request handling, the ``next`` continuation can be
invoked to jump to the next status handler in the queue. The error message is
passed automatically, so you do not have to manually propagate the state.

.. code:: vala

    app.status (Soup.Status.NOT_FOUND, (req, res, next) => {
        next ();
    });

    app.status (Soup.Status.NOT_FOUND, (req, res) => {
        res.status = 404;
        res.body.write ("Not found!".data);
    });

:doc:`redirection-and-error` can be thrown during the status handling, they
will be caught by the ``Router`` and processed accordingly.

.. code:: vala

    // turns any 404 into a permanent redirection
    app.status (Soup.Status.NOT_FOUND, (req, res) => {
        throw new Redirection.PERMANENT ("http://example.com");
    });

Scoping
-------

Scoping is a powerful prefixing mechanism for rules and regular expressions.
Route declarations within a scope will be prefixed by ``<scope>/``. There is an
implicit initial scope so that all rules are automatically rooted with (``/``).

The ``Router`` maintains a scope stack so that when the program flow enter
a scope, it pushes the fragment on top of that stack and pops it when it exits.

The default separator is a ``/`` and it might become possible to change it in
a future release.

.. code:: vala

    app.scope ("admin", (admin) => {
        // admin is a scoped Router
        app.get ("users", (req, res) => {
            // matches /admin/users
        });
    });

    app.get ("users", (req, res) => {
        // matches /users
    });

Subrouting
----------

Since ``VSGI.ApplicationCallback`` is type compatible with ``HandlerCallback``,
it is possible to delegate request handling to another VSGI-compliant
application.

.. code:: vala

    var app = new Router ();
    var api = new Router ();

    // delegate all GET requests to api router
    app.get ("<any:any>", api.handle);

This feature can be used to combine independently working applications in
a single one, as opposed to :doc:`module`, which are designed to be
specifically integrated in a working application.

It is important to be cautious since the pair of request-response may be the
target of side-effects such as:

-  parent router ``setup`` and ``teardown`` signals can operate before and
   after the delegated handler
-  matcher that matched the request before being delegated may initialize the
   :doc:`vsgi/request` parameters

In the example, the ``<any:any>`` parameter will initialize the
:doc:`vsgi/request` parameters.

Next
----

The :doc:`route` handler takes a callback as an optional third argument. This
callback is a continuation that will continue the routing process to the next
matching route.

.. code:: vala

    app.get ("", (req, res, next) => {
        message ("pre");
        next (); // keep routing
    });

    app.get ("", (req, res) => {
        // this is invoked!
    });

Additionally, a state can be propagated in a ``next`` invocation to transmit
data to the next handler in the queue.

.. code:: vala

    app.get ("", (req, res, next) => {
        message ("pre");
        var state = new Object ();
        next (state); // propagate the state
    });

    app.get ("", (req, res, next, state) => {
        // perform an operation with the provided state
    });

The ``Router`` will automatically propagate the state, so calling ``next``
without argument is a safe operation.

Invoke
------

It is possible to invoke a ``NextCallback`` in the routing context when the
latter is lost. This happens whenever you have to execute ``next`` in an async
callback.

The function provides an invocation context that handles thrown status code
with custom and default status code handlers. It constitute an entry point for
``handle`` where the next callback performs the actual routing.

.. code:: vala

    app.get ("", (req, res, next) => {
        res.body.write_async ("Hello world!".data, Priority.DEFAULT, null, () => {
            app.invoke (req, res, next);
        });
    });

    app.all (null, (req, res) => {
        throw new ClientError.NOT_FOUND ("the requested resource was not found");
    });

    app.status (404, (req, res) => {
        // produce a 404 page...
    });

Similarly to ``handle``, this function can be used to perform something similar
to subrouting by executing a ``NextCallback`` in the context of another router.

The following example handles a situation where a client with the
``Accept: text/html`` header defined attempts to access an API that produces
responses designed for non-human client.

.. code:: vala

    var app = new Router ();
    var api = new Router ();

    api.matcher (accept ("text/html"), (req, res) => {a
        // let the app produce a human-readable response as the client accepts
        // 'text/html' response
        app.invoke (req, res, () => {
            throw ClientError.NOT_ACCEPTABLE ("this is an API");
        });
    });

    app.status (Status.NOT_ACCEPTABLE, (req, res) => {
        res.body.write ("<p>%s</p>".printf (state.get_string ()).data);
    });

Middleware
----------

Anything that does not handle the user request, typically by invoking ``next``,
is considered to be a middleware. Two kind of middleware can coexist to provide
reusable matching and handling capabilities.

Matching middleware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These middlewares respect the ``Route.MatcherCallback`` delegate signature.

The following piece of code is a reusable and generic content negociator:

.. code:: vala

    public MatcherCallback accept (string content_type) {
        return (req) => {
            return req.headers.get_one ("Accept") == content_type;
        };
    }

It is not really powerful as it does not support fuzzy matching like
``application/*``, but it demonstrates the potential capabilities.

It can conveniently be used as a matcher callback to capture all requests that
accept the ``application/json`` content type as a response.

.. code:: vala

    app.matcher (accept ("application/json"), (req, res) => {
        // produce a JSON output...
    });

Handling middleware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These middlewares are reusable piece of processing that can perform various
work from authentication to the delivery of a static resource.

It is possible for a handling middleware to pass a state to the next handling
route, allowing them to produce content that can be consumed instead of simply
processing the :doc:`vsgi/request` or :doc:`vsgi/response`.

The following example shows a middleware that provide a compressed stream over
the :doc:`vsgi/response` body.

.. code:: vala

    app.get (null, (req, res, next) => {
        res.headers ("Content-Encoding", "gzip");
        next (new ConverterOutputStream (new ZLibCompressor ("gzip", res.body));
    });

    app.get ("home", (req, res, next, state) => {
        OutputStream body = state;
        body.write ("Hello world!".data); // transparently compress the output
    });

If this is wrapped in a function, it can even be used directly from the
handler.

.. code:: vala

    HandlerCallback compress = (req, res, next) => {
        res.headers ("Content-Encoding", "gzip");
        next (new ConverterOutputStream (new ZLibCompressor ("gzip", res.body));
    };

    app.get ("home", (req, res) => {
        compress (req, res, (state) => {
            OutputStream body = state;
            body.write ("Hello world!".data);
        })
    })

Resources
=========

GLib provides an `resource
api <http://valadoc.org/#!api=gio-2.0/GLib.Resource>`__ for bundling
static resources and link them in the executable.

An efficient approach to serve static content with Valum is to link and
stream.

It has a few advantages:

-  content is compiled with the executable or bundled separately, so it
   loads lightning fast
-  resource api is simpler than file api
-  application do not have to deal with resource location or minimally
   if a separate bundle is used

This only applies to small and static resources as it will grow the size
of the executable. If you have to change your resources at runtime, it
will require an additionnal compilation step.

Integration
-----------

Let's say your project has a few resources:

-  CTPL templates in a ``templates`` folder
-  CSS, JavaScript files in ``static`` folder

Setup a ``app.gresource.xml`` file that defines what resources will to
be bundled.

.. code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <gresources>
      <gresource>
        <file>templates/home.html</file>
        <file>templates/404.html</file>
        <file>static/css/bootstrap.min.css</file>
      </gresource>
    </gresources>

You can test your setup with:

.. code:: bash

    glib-compile-resource app.gresource.xml

Latest version of ``waf`` automatically link ``*.gresource.xml`` if you
load the ``glib2`` plugin and add the file to your sources.

.. code:: python

    bld.load('glib2')

    bld.program(
       packages  = ['glib-2.0', 'libsoup-2.4', 'gee-0.8', 'ctpl', 'lua', 'libmemcached'],
       target    = 'app',
       use       = 'valum',
       source    = bld.path.ant_glob('**/*.vala') + ['app.gresource.xml'],
       uselib    = ['GLIB', 'CTPL', 'GEE', 'SOUP', 'LUA', 'MEMCACHED'],
       vapi_dirs = ['../../vapi', 'vapi'])

The sample application example serve its static resources this way if
you need a more concrete example.
